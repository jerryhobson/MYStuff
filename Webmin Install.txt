Step 1 — Installing Webmin

First, we need to add the Webmin repository so that we can easily install and update Webmin using our package manager. We do this by adding the repository to the /etc/apt/sources.list file.

Open the file in your editor:

	sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list

Then add this line to the bottom of the file to add the new repository:
 . . . 
	deb http://download.webmin.com/download/repository sarge contrib

Save the file and exit the editor.

Next, add the Webmin PGP key so that your system will trust the new repository:

	wget http://www.webmin.com/jcameron-key.asc
	sudo apt-key add jcameron-key.asc

Next, update the list of packages to include the Webmin repository:

	sudo apt-get update 

Then install Webmin:

	sudo apt-get install webmin 

Once the installation finishes, you be presented with the following output:

Output
Webmin install complete. You can now login to 
https://your_server_ip:10000 as root with your 
root password, or as any user who can use `sudo`.
